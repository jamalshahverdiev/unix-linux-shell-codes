#### If you want to use all these scripts, firstly we must move [.aws](https://progit.tk/devops_user/bash-codes/tree/master/AWS-Codes/.aws) folder under home folder **~** and execute [~/.aws/encryptDecryptFiles.sh](https://progit.tk/devops_user/bash-codes/blob/master/AWS-Codes/.aws/encryptDecryptFiles.sh) script which requires password to decrypt AWS [config](https://progit.tk/devops_user/bash-codes/blob/master/AWS-Codes/.aws/config) and [credentials](https://progit.tk/devops_user/bash-codes/blob/master/AWS-Codes/.aws/credentials) files. After that we can use any of **aws** CLI commands. If you want encrypt new files just comment **decryptFiles** and uncomment **ecryptFiles** function inside of the **~/.aws/encryptDecryptFiles.sh** script file.
